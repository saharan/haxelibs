Personal Haxe libraries used to make interactive web contents, may or may not be useful

---

- Muun: A linear algebra lib, everything will be inlined so that I can use vectors and matrices and stuff without suffering from GC
- Pot: An all-in-one engine to make web apps, imagine something like Processing
- Std: Useful global functions, supposed to be imported using [`import.hx`](https://haxe.org/manual/type-system-import-defaults.html)
